Pitt Pathfinder is a navigation app build for IOS using React Native. The app gives directions from the users current location to any target destination.

## For Non-Developers

This part of the README file is targeted towards those with less programming experience, especially in React Native. Rather than going over how the app works, this sections describes how to use the app. You can scroll down to the <i>For Developers</i> section if you want a more complicated, but in-depth rundown.

### Installation

Because Pitt Pathfinder is not an offically published app, it cannot be downloaded from the App Store. You can still install the app using the official source code in the Github repository, however, installation is rather advanced. If you aren't an experienced developer, it is recommended that you watch the demo videos provided in this section instead. If you still wish to install the app onto a simulator or a physical IOS device, you can go to the <i>Installation For Developers</i> section for instructions.
